# Project  Implementation Instructions

# Overview

This application is a highly professional, production-grade insurance form suite. You will be designing **multi-step** forms based on the specifications provided. Please read and respect every detail here to ensure the forms are functional, responsive, secure, and precise.



##  GENERAL RULES

‚úÖ Each form has its own **name**. Use that name in the component and directory structure.  
‚úÖ Each form is divided into **sections**. Each section should be treated as a single *step* in a stepper, in the order they appear in the provided data.  
‚úÖ Every section name should be clearly shown as a step in the stepper UI, so the user can see what section they are on.  
‚úÖ The *last* section should always include **data privacy & declaration**, with signature and date (prefilled with today‚Äôs date), plus a checkbox for agreement. The declaration block text is standard and included below.  
‚úÖ Once the user ticks the declaration, a `summary-dialog` modal appears showing all form data in review mode, letting them confirm or edit before final submit.  
‚úÖ After final submit, save the form data to the Firebase Firestore database, and upload any files to Firebase Storage under organized folders.  
‚úÖ Send a **success email** to the user after successful submission.  
‚úÖ After successful submission, display a **success modal** with a smooth professional animation. Underneath, include a **note** section with contact details for claim status and inquiries (using the language in the current printed forms).  



# FIELD RULES

‚úÖ All required fields should have a clear `*` indicator.  
‚úÖ Every field must have a **tooltip** describing its purpose.  
‚úÖ Validate all fields thoroughly (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses, numeric ranges, dates, etc.).  
‚úÖ If a field combines multiple pieces of information in one line, split them with clear labels.  

## CONDITIONAL

‚úÖ For yes/no or boolean fields with follow-ups like ‚ÄúIf yes, explain,‚Äù only show the next field if yes .  
‚úÖ For options with ‚ÄúOther,‚Äù show a conditional text field for specification. Label it unambiguously.

### AUTOCOMPLETE FIELDS

‚úÖ For **country** or **nationality** fields: use an autocomplete with country flags.  
‚úÖ For **state** and **city** fields: filter dynamically by chosen country/state.  
‚úÖ For country-issued or passport-issuing fields, use the same autocomplete style.  
‚úÖ **Prioritize these autocomplete instructions** over any JSX snippets.

### MULTIPLE-ENTRY FIELDS

‚úÖ Where repeatable data (like directors or witnesses) is collected, include an **Add** button to dynamically add multiple entries.  
‚úÖ Allow delete/remove per added entry.

### TABLE-STYLE FIELDS

‚úÖ For list of items with amounts/descriptions/totals, use an interactive table with ‚ÄúAdd Row.‚Äù  
‚úÖ For fixed series rows (like months 1‚Äì12), build them statically.



## üìå FILE UPLOADS

‚úÖ Accept only `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf` under 3MB.  
‚úÖ Place file upload inputs exactly where requested.  
‚úÖ Store uploads in folders named by form type.



## üìå PERSISTENCE 

‚úÖ Save to `localStorage` on every change, with one-week expiry.  
‚úÖ Encrypt localStorage (e.g., AES) to protect sensitive data.

---

## üìå RESPONSIVENESS & INTERACTIVITY

‚úÖ Responsive on all devices.  
‚úÖ Add smooth but fast step transitions (no more than 250ms).  
‚úÖ Use skeleton loaders to prevent lag.  
‚úÖ Clean, readable, professional styling.



##üìå SUMMARY MODAL

‚úÖ After the user signs/date-stamps and checks declaration:  
- Show a **summary-dialog** with all entries  
- Allow final edits  
‚úÖ Then submit to Firestore + Storage + send confirmation email  
‚úÖ Show a success modal with an animation and note for follow-up

-

## üìå FIREBASE RULES

‚úÖ Use clear, consistent collections for each form  
‚úÖ Store uploaded files in folders matching form names  
‚úÖ Send confirmation emails  
‚úÖ Keep field names consistent

---

## üìå REMINDER

**For each form below:**

- Follow this structure exactly  
- Parse sections in order  
- Keep validations strong  
- Support dynamic repeatable entries  
- Apply autocomplete for countries, states, cities, and nationalities  
- Use correct constraints for file uploads  
- Add the summary-dialog + success modal  
- Always use a professional success note for follow-up
