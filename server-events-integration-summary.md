# Events Log Integration Summary

## Server-Side Implementation Complete ✅

### Core Features Added:

#### 1. **Enhanced Form Submission Logging**
```javascript
// Modified handleFormSubmission function to include:
- Event logging for all form submissions
- Admin email notification logging  
- Submitter tracking with user details
- Form metadata capture
```

#### 2. **Authentication Event Logging**
```javascript
// Login endpoint now logs:
- Successful login events with user details
- Failed login attempts with error details
- IP tracking and geolocation
- User agent and timestamp capture
```

#### 3. **Form View Tracking**
```javascript
// New endpoint: GET /api/forms/:collection/:id
- Logs when users view specific forms
- Tracks viewer identity and permissions
- Records view timestamp and metadata
```

#### 4. **Comprehensive Form Routes**
```javascript
// New form submission endpoints:
POST /submit-kyc-individual
POST /submit-kyc-corporate  
POST /submit-cdd-individual
POST /submit-cdd-corporate
POST /submit-cdd-agents
POST /submit-cdd-brokers
POST /submit-cdd-partners
POST /submit-claim-motor
POST /submit-claim-fire
POST /submit-claim-burglary
POST /submit-claim-all-risk
```

#### 5. **Additional Event Types**
```javascript
// User Registration Logging
POST /api/register-user

// File Download Tracking  
GET /api/download/:fileType/:documentId

// Sample Event Generation (Development)
POST /api/generate-sample-events
```

### Event Schema Implementation:
```javascript
{
  ts: timestamp,
  action: 'submit|approve|reject|edit|delete|login|failed-login|view|email-sent|file-download|register',
  actorUid: string,
  actorDisplayName: string,
  actorEmail: string,
  actorRole: string,
  targetType: 'kyc-form|cdd-form|claim|user|email|file',
  targetId: string,
  details: object, // Action-specific data
  ipMasked: string, // Privacy-protected IP
  ipHash: string,   // For correlation
  location: string, // Geolocation
  userAgent: string,
  meta: object      // Additional metadata
}
```

### Security & Privacy Features:
- ✅ IP masking for privacy protection
- ✅ IP hashing with salt for correlation
- ✅ Configurable raw IP retention (30 days default)
- ✅ Admin-only access to events API
- ✅ Advanced view includes sensitive fields
- ✅ Regular view excludes IP/location data

### Sample Events Auto-Generated:
The server now generates realistic sample events on startup including:
- User form submissions
- Admin approvals/rejections
- Compliance staff form views  
- Login activities
- System email notifications

### Integration Checklist Complete:
- [x] Form submissions logged
- [x] Approval/rejection actions logged
- [x] View events captured
- [x] Login attempts tracked
- [x] Email notifications logged
- [x] File downloads tracked
- [x] User registrations logged
- [x] IP processing middleware active
- [x] Geolocation enrichment enabled
- [x] Sample events generated
- [x] Admin API endpoints functional
- [x] Privacy controls implemented

## Next Steps:
1. **Events should now be visible** in the frontend Events Log page
2. **Refresh the page** to see populated sample events
3. **Test real events** by using the form submission endpoints
4. **Configure Firestore indexes** if needed for large datasets
5. **Set up scheduled cleanup** for expired raw IPs

## Production Considerations:
- Monitor Firestore write costs for high-volume events
- Consider BigQuery export for heavy analytics
- Implement proper authentication middleware for all endpoints
- Set up automated cleanup of expired IP data
- Configure appropriate log retention policies
